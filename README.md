# Design and Simulation of a Quadrotor Controller Using MATLAB Simulink

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and simulation of a quadrotor control system, structured into four distinct phases. It provides insights into the dynamics, modeling, control strategies, and testing of quadrotor systems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into four main folders, each corresponding to a phase of the project:

1. Phase1_DynamicsDerivation
2. Phase2_Linearization
3. Phase3_Modeling
4. Phase4_ControlStrategyDesignTestingValidation

Each folder contains MATLAB and Simulink code specific to that phase.

## Phases of the Project

### Phase 1: Dynamics Derivation

In this phase, we derive the differential equations governing the quadrotor's dynamics, establishing a foundation for understanding its motion in a six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) environment.

### Phase 2: Linearization

The second phase emphasizes, Linearizing equations from Phase 1 around equilibrium point and derive transfer functions between each input and output. Also, extracting system transfer functions using Simulink

### Phase 3: Modeling

This phase involves modeling the quadrotor using SolidWorks and Simscape, integrating dynamic equations with simulation tools to visualize and analyze system behavior.

### Phase 4: Control Strategy Design, Testing and Validation

In the final phase, emphasizes designing a control strategy utilizing methods such as Root Locus to ensure the stability and responsiveness of the quadrotor under various conditions.

Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive testing and validation of the control system through simulations, assessing performance metrics such as stability, response time, and robustness against external disturbances.
